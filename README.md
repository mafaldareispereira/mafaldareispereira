### Hi there / Olá 👋

I'm a P.h.D. Student in Agrarian Sciences at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto and researcher at INESC TEC (Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science).

I am currently developing my dissertation on the theme "Early detection and identification of plant diseases caused by bacteria based on proximal sensing in a precision agriculture perspective". 

To achieve the early disease diagnosis I perfom applied predictive classification modeling, using supervised machine learning models. I program in R, but I'm also currently trying to learn Python. If you are curious you can check my publications on my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6809-008X), on my [CIÊNCIAVITAE](https://www.cienciavitae.pt//pt/AF1E-7ACE-E9E4), and on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mafaldareispereira/).

In terms of crops, I work essentially with tomato and kiwi plants 🍅🥝 , but also with tobacco and grapevine 🌱🍇. In terms of pathogens, I work mostly with bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, and Xanthomonas euvesicatoria 🦠🧫), and had some contact with grapevine pathogenic fungi (Plasmopara viticola, Uncinula necator).

 I enjoy sharing experiences and knowledge with other professionals and I am always interested in establishing new contacts!
