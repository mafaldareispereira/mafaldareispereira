### Hi there / Olá 👋

I'm a P.h.D. Candidate in Agrarian Sciences at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Porto and researcher at INESC TEC (Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering, Technology and Science).

I am currently developing my dissertation on the theme "Early detection and identification of plant diseases caused by bacteria based on proximal sensing in a precision agriculture perspective". 

To achieve the early disease diagnosis I perfom applied predictive classification modeling, using supervised machine learning models. I program in R, but I'm also currently trying to learn Python. If you are curious you can check my publications on my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6809-008X), on my [CIÊNCIAVITAE](https://www.cienciavitae.pt//pt/AF1E-7ACE-E9E4), and on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mafaldareispereira/).

In terms of crops, I work essentially with tomato and kiwi plants 🍅🥝 , but also with tobacco and grapevine 🌱🍇. In terms of pathogens, I work mostly with bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, and Xanthomonas euvesicatoria 🦠🧫), and had some contact with grapevine pathogenic fungi (Plasmopara viticola, Uncinula necator).

Throughout my academic career, I had the opportunity to integrate and lead a group of volunteers in the subject of Social Therapeutic Horticulture, having developed a taste for fieldwork and teamwork. During my Master's dissertation, I had the opportunity to develop predictive phenological models of the sprouting and flowering of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) and to analyze the pollen quality of different Portuguese grape varieties and some French grape varieties. Furthermore, I worked in a software company that specializes in the development of management and accounting software for agriculture, viticulture, and agribusiness sectors. ‍💻💼

 I enjoy sharing experiences and knowledge with other professionals and I am always interested in establishing new contacts!
